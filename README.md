# Windows 95 Portfolio

Welcome to the Windows 95-inspired responsive web portfolio GitHub repository! This project combines the nostalgic look of the Windows 95 operating system with modern web technologies, including React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. It emulates the classic Windows 95 interface with draggable, resizable, and interactive windows with the help of Framer Motion. Additionally, it manages the global state using React's Context API and the useReducer hook.

## Demo

You can check out a live demo of the Windows 95 Portfolio <a href="https://renishkar-portfolio.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>

## Features

1. **Interactive Windows Icons:**
   - Each section of the portfolio, such as About, Contact, and Projects, is represented by an icon.
   - Single-clicking on an icon selects it.
   - Double-clicking on an icon opens the respective section in a separate draggable window, just like in Windows OS.

2. **Window Management:**
   - Windows can be minimized to the taskbar.
   - Windows can be maximized to occupy the full screen.
   - Windows can be closed.
   - Windows are draggable and can be placed anywhere on the screen.

3. **Window Focus:**
   - When multiple windows are open simultaneously, clicking on a window brings it to the front and makes it the active window.
   - The application keeps track of the order in which windows are opened. When a window is closed, focus shifts to the previously opened window.

4. **Global State Management:**
   - The application's global state is managed using React's Context API along with the useReducer hook.

5. **Contact Page:**
   - The Contact page is designed to resemble a mail app.
   - Users can send messages through the app, and this functionality is powered by the `email.js` package.

6. **Responsiveness:**
   - The application is designed to be responsive, catering to both small and large screens.
